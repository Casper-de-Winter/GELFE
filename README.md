Generalized Extended Learning Feature Engineering 

 --- Download data ---
 
 DataDL & kNN_Impute 
 
 Run DataDL to run all code
 
 In order to download the data. For all manual necessary changes and to see which final data sets should be kept, see the thesis
 

 --- Training Phase ---
 
 MainTrain, DataSetTrainV2, OperatorsV2, MetaFeature & MetaModel
 
 Run Maintrain to run all code
 
 Afterward, run MetaModel to create metamodels
 

 --- Feature Engineering & Evaluation Phase ---
 
 TPOTAutoML, MainAutoFE, OperatorsFE, MetaFeature, CMI & entropy_estimators
 
 Use the tpot files in the tpot folder instead of the ones found online due to some small changes
 
 For the selection method, CMI & entropy_estimators are the used files.


 --- Create graphs and all results ---
